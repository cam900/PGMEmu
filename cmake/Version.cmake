# Taken from NGA's cmake/Version.cmake.
#
# The version the binary reports is the tag the build was made from: a release
# is a tag `vX.Y.Z`, and there is no number in this tree to keep in step with
# the tags, which is why `project()` carries no `VERSION`. A build with no tag to
# describe reports `devel`, and so does a build from a source archive with no
# repository around it: a binary that is not a release should not name one.
#
# `git describe` is asked at configure time rather than at build time, because a
# version string does not earn a target that runs whether anything changed or
# not. What keeps the answer fresh is CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS over the four
# places git writes when the answer could have changed. Which four was measured,
# not assumed: a commit appends to `logs/HEAD` and leaves `HEAD` alone, a tag
# written or moved changes the mtime of the `refs/tags` directory, `HEAD` itself
# moves on a checkout, and `packed-refs` moves when the loose refs are packed
# away. Between them a configure is re-run whenever a commit or a tag could have
# changed what `describe` answers.
