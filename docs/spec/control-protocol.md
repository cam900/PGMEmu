# The control protocol

This document specifies how a client controls the emulator: what it sends, and what it gets back.
Why there is one protocol, and why it is the RTL simulator's, is
[0005](../decisions/0005-one-control-api.md). The simulator's own description,
`../Arcade-IGSPGM_MiSTer/docs/sim-server.md`, is the baseline. This document says where the
emulator matches it and what it adds.

There is one set of methods (§6). Two protocols carry them:

- **JSON lines**, in the format of §2 and §3, on stdio or TCP.
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol), where each method is a tool, on stdio or HTTP.

A method takes the same parameters and gives the same result in both.

## 0. Quick start

Start a server on TCP, then send JSON lines from a shell. All connections control the same
emulator.

```sh
pgmemu-cli --server tcp:7701 --bios pgm.zip --rom-dir images orlegend &
printf '%s\n' '{"id":1,"method":"emu.run_frames","params":{"count":600}}' \
              '{"id":2,"method":"video.screenshot","params":{"path":"shot.png"}}' | nc -w 60 127.0.0.1 7701
```

```json
{"id":1,"ok":true,"result":{"reason":"completed","ticks_executed":506035225,"frames_executed":600}}
{"id":2,"ok":true,"result":{"width":448,"height":224,"frame":600,"path":"shot.png"}}
```

These answers come from orlegend. Other games give other numbers.

`scripts/pgmemu.py` sends one request per call. It prints the `result` as indented JSON. On an
error, it prints the error on stderr and exits with status 1.

```sh
scripts/pgmemu.py --port 7701 emu.run_frames count=600
scripts/pgmemu.py --port 7701 memory.read region=WORK_RAM address=0x1478 size=4
```

For an AI agent, use MCP. On stdio, the client starts the server itself. The desktop application
serves MCP on HTTP, and the client connects to it.

```sh
claude mcp add pgmemu -- /path/to/pgmemu-cli --mcp --bios /path/to/pgm.zip --rom-dir /path/to/images
pgmemu --mcp-http 7702 &                                   # the desktop application, then
claude mcp add --transport http pgmemu http://127.0.0.1:7702/mcp
```

Other MCP clients take a configuration like this one:

```json
{"mcpServers":{"pgmemu":{"command":"/path/to/pgmemu-cli","args":["--mcp","--bios","/path/to/pgm.zip","--rom-dir","/path/to/images"]}}}
```

## 1. Transports

### JSON lines on stdio

`pgmemu-cli --server` reads requests on stdin and writes responses on stdout.

- Each request is one line with one JSON object. Each response is one line with one JSON object.
- Responses are written in the order of the requests. Each response is flushed.
- Blank lines are skipped. They get no response.
- A line can end with `\n` or `\r\n`. There is no limit on its length. A newline inside a string
  must be escaped, as JSON requires.
- stdout carries only responses. Logs go to stderr. The server writes one line about itself to
  stderr when it starts.
- The server stops when stdin ends.

This is the simulator's framing, so a script written against `./sim --server` drives the emulator
unchanged.

### JSON lines on TCP

`pgmemu-cli --server tcp:PORT` serves the same lines on TCP. It listens on 127.0.0.1 only. It runs
until the process is stopped.

- Any number of connections can be open.
- Each connection has its own stream of lines. Its responses come in the order of its requests.
- A connection ends when the client closes it.
- All connections control **the same** emulator. A game that one client loads is the game that
  all clients see.
- Requests from all connections are answered one at a time. Each request is finished before the
  next one starts.

This lets a script or an agent keep one emulator across many short commands, as
`scripts/pgmemu.py` does.

There is no authentication. Anyone who can open a connection on this machine controls the
emulator. They can also make it read and write files, by the paths they give to methods such as
`emu.load_game`, `video.screenshot`, `audio.capture_start` and `state.save`.

### JSON lines from the desktop application

`pgmemu --server tcp:PORT` serves the same lines from the desktop application, while its window is
open ([0012](../decisions/0012-network-transports.md)).

- Requests from all connections, and what is done in the window, are handled in turn on the
  emulation thread, between two frames. They act on the game on screen.
- The window runs the game by itself, a frame at a time. `emu.pause` stops that; requests are
  still answered. A breakpoint or a watchpoint that the window's own run reaches pauses it too.
- The sound of a run made on request is not played.

### MCP on stdio

`pgmemu-cli --mcp` serves the Model Context Protocol on stdio. Messages are JSON-RPC 2.0, one per
line, framed like the JSON lines above.

- The server answers `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`.
- `initialize` gives the protocol revision the client asks for, if it is one of `2025-11-25`,
  `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26` or `2024-11-05`. Otherwise it gives `2025-11-25`. The only capability
  is `tools`. The server's name is `pgmemu`, and its version is the one `emu.status` gives. The
  `instructions` are a short paragraph on how to begin.
- A message without an `id` is a notification. It gets no answer. `notifications/initialized` is
  one of these.
- Batches (JSON arrays) are not supported.
- Each method in §6 is a tool. The tool's name is the method's name with `_` in place of `.`:
  `emu.run_frames` becomes `emu_run_frames`. The `sim.` aliases (§5) are left out. The tool's
  description and `inputSchema` are the method's. The tool's `arguments` are the method's
  `params`.
- A tool's answer is a `content` array. It holds the method's `result` as JSON text. When the
  result holds a PNG (`video.screenshot` without a `path`), the PNG comes first, as an `image` of
  type `image/png`, and it is removed from the text.
- When a method fails, the tool result has `isError` set. Its one text is `CODE: message`, with
  the codes of §4.

Only these cases are JSON-RPC errors:

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| -32700 | The line is not JSON. The answer has `id` `null`. |
| -32600 | Not a JSON-RPC 2.0 request: not an object, `jsonrpc` is not `"2.0"`, or `method` is missing or not a string. |
| -32601 | A method other than the four above. |
| -32602 | `tools/call` without a `name`, or with a name that is not a tool. |

### MCP on HTTP, from the desktop application

`pgmemu --mcp-http PORT` serves MCP's Streamable HTTP transport from the desktop application, at
`http://127.0.0.1:PORT/mcp`.

- Each message is the body of a POST.
- The answer to a request is the body of the response, as `application/json`.
- A notification gets `202 Accepted`, with no body.
- A body that is not JSON gets `400`, with the -32700 error.
- The server does not stream. A GET gets `405`.
- The server does not issue an `Mcp-Session-Id`. All clients control the same emulator, as on TCP.
- A request with an `Origin` header that is not a page on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` gets `403`. A
  request without `Origin` (from a program, not a browser) is served.

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7702/mcp -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"emu_status","arguments":{}}}'
```

The application and its servers act on the game on screen. When a client loads a game, it
replaces the game in the window. When a file is dropped onto the window, it replaces what the
clients see.

### A game at start

`pgmemu-cli --server`, `--mcp` and `--transcript` take a game after their flags, as the desktop
application does: a set name (`pgm` for the BIOS alone) or the path of a `.pgm`. It is loaded
before the first request, as `emu.load_game` loads it. If it cannot be loaded, the program says
why on stderr and exits with status 1.

```sh
pgmemu-cli --mcp --bios pgm.zip --rom-dir images orlegend
```

### Transcripts

`pgmemu-cli --transcript FILE` answers the requests in FILE, one per line, and prints the answers
on stdout. Blank lines and lines that start with `#` are skipped. With `--mcp`, the lines are MCP
messages, and a notification has no answer.

With `--expect ANSWERS`, the answers are compared line by line with the lines of ANSWERS, instead
of being printed. The first difference is printed. The exit status is 0 when all lines are equal,
and 1 otherwise.

An answer holds the build's version as `devel`. So a recorded transcript reads the same whatever
build recorded it, and any build checks it in the same way. `tests/control/` holds the
transcripts CTest checks.

## 2. Requests

```json
{"id":1,"method":"emu.status","params":{}}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | A non-negative integer, echoed in the response. The protocol does not require ids to be unique or increasing; a client that wants to match responses keeps them so. |
| `method` | yes | The method's name. |
| `params` | no | An object. A method that takes no parameters is given `{}` when it is left out. |

Other fields are ignored. Parameters that a method does not use are ignored.

Names are case-sensitive. So are parameter values that are names (`region`, `cpu`, `access`).

A parameter that is a non-negative integer (an address, a size, a count) can be a JSON integer,
or a string of hex digits after `0x` or `$`: `"0x1478"`, `"$1478"`. Answers always give integers.
The `id` must be a JSON integer.

## 3. Responses

A request that succeeded:

```json
{"id":1,"ok":true,"result":{"version":"devel"}}
```

A request that failed:

```json
{"id":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code":"unknown_method","message":"Unknown method: emu.nonsense"}}
```

- Keys appear in the order shown, as the simulator writes them.
- `error.code` is stable and meant for programs; `error.message` is for people and may change.
- A request whose `id` cannot be read is answered under `id` 0. That covers text that is not
  JSON, JSON that is not an object, and an `id` that is missing, negative or not an integer.
- Every request is answered. A malformed one never ends the session.

## 4. Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bad_request` | The request is malformed: not JSON, not an object, `id` or `method` missing or of the wrong type, `params` not an object, or a parameter missing, of the wrong type or out of its bounds. |
| `unknown_method` | No method of that name exists. |
| `unknown_game` | `emu.load_game` was given a name with no `<name>.pgm` in the ROM directory, or a name that is not a set name. |
| `load_failed` | A game could not be loaded: the file is not a valid `.pgm` ([pgm-format.md](pgm-format.md)), or the BIOS is missing or wrong. The message names the file and the fault. |
| `unknown_region` | A region was asked for that the game cannot run as: not a four-character code, not among the image's regions, or without the data its protection needs. The message lists the regions there are. |
| `no_cartridge` | The method needs a cartridge, and none is loaded. |
| `not_loaded` | The method needs a running machine, and no game is loaded. |
| `screenshot_failed` | The picture could not be encoded or written. |
| `invalid_signal` | A condition names a signal the emulator does not have (§6, `emu.run_until`). |
| `no_cpu` | The CPU asked for is not on the loaded board: the ARM7 of a game without an IGS027A. |
| `invalid_region` | No memory region of that name holds anything now, or `memory.write` was given a region it cannot write: a ROM. |
| `invalid_range` | The bytes asked for, or given to `memory.write`, run past the end of the region. |
| `capture_running` | `audio.capture_start` while a capture is running. |
| `capture_not_running` | `audio.capture_stop` with no capture running. |
| `capture_failed` | The capture's file could not be written. |
| `invalid_input` | An `input.` method was given a name it does not know. |
| `state_failed` | A save state could not be written or read. |
| `state_mismatch` | A save state is not one of the game loaded, or not of this build's format. |
| `nvram_failed` | An NVRAM file could not be written, or is not 128 KB. |
| `debug_link_timeout` | The test ROM did not publish its debug link, or did not take the bytes, in the time given. |

`unknown_method`, `unknown_game`, `load_failed`, `invalid_region`, `invalid_signal`,
`invalid_input` and `bad_request` mean what the simulator means by them. `no_cartridge`, `not_loaded`,
`invalid_range`, `unknown_region`, `no_cpu` and the `capture_` codes are the emulator's own: the simulator does not check a
range, always has a machine, and captures sound by other methods (§6, `audio.capture_start`).

## 5. Names shared with the simulator

Every `sim.<name>` method the emulator implements is an alias of `emu.<name>`. The alias answers
exactly what the `emu.` method answers, so a script written against `./sim --server` runs
unchanged.

## 6. Methods

### `emu.status` (alias `sim.status`)

Takes no parameters.

```json
{"id":1,"ok":true,"result":{"version":"devel","game_name":"orlegend","region":"WRLD","total_ticks":844900,"frame":1,"paused":false}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | The emulator's version: the release tag it was built from, or `devel`. |
| `game_name` | The short name of the loaded cartridge, `pgm` when the BIOS alone is loaded, or `null` before anything is. |
| `region` | The code of the region the game runs as: the one it was loaded or set with, or the one its image holds. `null` when the image has no regions, or holds a value its table does not name. |
| `total_ticks` | Master ticks (50 MHz) since the machine was powered up by loading the game; absent before a game is loaded. |
| `frame` | Frame boundaries passed since then (`emu.run_frames`); absent before a game is loaded. |
| `paused` | Whether the desktop application's own run is paused (`emu.pause`). Always present; `pgmemu-cli` has no run of its own. |
| `breakpoint`, `watchpoint` | Present when the last run stopped at one: the same object as in that run's answer (`emu.run_frames`). So a client that attaches to a window that stopped by itself sees where. |

The simulator's other status fields (`running`, ...) are added as the state they describe comes
to exist, under the simulator's names.

### `emu.pause`, `emu.resume`

`emu.pause` stops the desktop application's own run. `emu.resume` starts it again. Both take no
parameters and answer `{}`.

- Runs on request (`emu.run_frames`, `emu.run_cycles`, `emu.run_until`, `input.press`) work in
  both states.
- `pgmemu-cli` has no run of its own. It runs only on request. There, these only set what
  `emu.status` says.
- A breakpoint or a watchpoint that the application's own run reaches also pauses it. The window
  shows where it stopped. Edit or remove the breakpoint, then `emu.resume`.

### `emu.load_game` (alias `sim.load_game`)

Loads a game and the BIOS. Exactly one of `name` and `path` is given:

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | A set name: `<name>.pgm` is taken from the ROM directory. `pgm` loads the BIOS alone. A name holds only letters, digits and underscores. |
| `path` | The path of a `.pgm` file. |
| `region` | Optional: the region the game runs as, one of the codes `emu.cartridge_info` lists under `region_info`, such as `JAPN`. Without it the game runs as its image holds: ASIC3's default, the IGS025's default, or what the ARM's internal ROM holds. |

```json
{"id":2,"method":"emu.load_game","params":{"name":"orlegend"}}
{"id":2,"ok":true,"result":{}}
```

Loading powers a new machine up: work RAM and VRAM are zero, the raster is at its first dot,
and the 68000 is held in reset for 100 master ticks, as the simulator's front end holds it. A
`sim.reset` before anything runs takes the place of those 100 ticks, so that the scripts written
for the simulator, which load and then reset, start the 68000 at the same moment.

The ROM directory and the BIOS sources are given when the emulator is started
(`pgmemu-cli --rom-dir DIR --bios PATH...`). The BIOS files are taken from the first BIOS source
that has each, so a directory with PGMTest's `pgm_p02s.u20` named before `pgm.zip` replaces the
program and keeps the rest.

Errors: `unknown_game`, `load_failed`, `unknown_region`, `bad_request`. A load that fails leaves
loaded what was loaded before it.

### `emu.set_region`

Powers the board up again with the loaded cartridge, its game made another region, as
`emu.load_game` with `region` would.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `region` | One of the codes `emu.cartridge_info` lists under `region_info`. |

Errors: `unknown_region` (the BIOS alone, or nothing, is loaded, or the game has no such region),
`bad_request`. A region refused leaves the game running undisturbed.

### `emu.set_bios`

Says where the BIOS files are taken from for the loads that follow, in place of the BIOS sources
the emulator was started with. What is loaded runs on undisturbed.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sources` | Paths of directories or zips, one or more, such as that of `pgm.zip`; the first that has a file wins. |

Errors: `bad_request`, when `sources` is empty or names a path that does not exist.

### `emu.cartridge_info`

Describes the loaded cartridge. Takes no parameters. `pgmemu-cli --info FILE` prints the same
for a file.

```json
{
  "short_name": "orlegend",
  "long_name": "Oriental Legend / Xiyou Shi E Zhuan (ver. 126)",
  "manufacturer": "IGS",
  "year": "1997",
  "format_version": "0022",
  "hardware": "asic3",
  "orientation": "horizontal",
  "roms": [ { "type": "PRG", "mapping": 1048576, "size": 2097152, "crc32": "d5e93543" } ],
  "region_info": { "scheme": "asic3", "default_region": 0, "regions": [ { "id": "WRLD", "value": 0 } ] }
}
```

- `hardware` takes the names in [pgm-format.md §2.1](pgm-format.md#21-hardware).
- `orientation` is `vertical` for a game whose monitor stood on its side, which draws its picture
  lying with its top at the left: the frame is seen upright turned a quarter anticlockwise. It is
  the image's flag ([pgm-format.md §2.2](pgm-format.md#22-flags)).
- `region_info` is `null` when the image has no region block.
- `patch_type` and `patch_offset` appear for the `asic27` scheme, and `default_region` for the
  `asic3` scheme.

Errors: `no_cartridge`.

### `memory.list_regions`

Takes no parameters. Answers the names of the regions that hold something now, as an array.

| Region | Holds |
|---|---|
| `BIOS_PROG_ROM` | `pgm_p02s.u20`, 128 KB |
| `BIOS_TILE_ROM` | `pgm_t01s.rom`, 2 MB |
| `BIOS_MUSIC_ROM` | `pgm_m01s.rom`, 2 MB |
| `CART_PROG_ROM` | The cartridge's PRG |
| `CART_TILE_ROM` | TLE |
| `CART_MUSIC_ROM` | AUD |
| `CART_A_ROM` | SPC |
| `CART_B_ROM` | SPM |
| `CART_ARM_ROM` | EXT |
| `CART_ARM_INT_ROM` | INT (the emulator's own name) |
| `CART_IGS022_ROM` | I22 (the emulator's own name) |
| `WORK_RAM` | 128 KB of 68000 work RAM, in the 68000's byte order |
| `VIDEO_RAM` | 32 KB of IGS023 VRAM as the chip's 8-bit RAM holds it: the upper byte of each 68000 word at the odd address |
| `PALETTE_RAM` | 8 KB of palette RAM, in the 68000's byte order |
| `AUDIO_RAM` | The Z80's 64 KB, by Z80 address |

The RAM regions exist while a game is loaded. Their layouts are the simulator's, so that the same
read of either answers bytes that can be compared one for one.

Every ROM region holds its ROM as the `.pgm` file does ([pgm-format.md §3](pgm-format.md#3-the-entry-table)),
and address 0 is the ROM's first byte, whatever its mapping. These are the names the simulator's
`memory.read` accepts, and the two answer the same bytes for the same request. The simulator's
own `memory.list_regions` lists older names that its `memory.read` refuses; the emulator lists the
names that work.

### `memory.read`

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `region` | A name from `memory.list_regions`. |
| `address` | Byte offset within the region. |
| `size` | Number of bytes, at most 1048576 (1 MB). Larger reads are made in pieces. |

```json
{"id":3,"method":"memory.read","params":{"region":"CART_PROG_ROM","address":0,"size":4}}
{"id":3,"ok":true,"result":{"region":"CART_PROG_ROM","address":0,"data_hex":"82000000"}}
```

`data_hex` holds two lowercase hex digits per byte, in address order.

Errors: `invalid_region`, `invalid_range`, `bad_request`.

### `memory.write`

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `region` | `WORK_RAM`, `VIDEO_RAM`, `PALETTE_RAM` or `AUDIO_RAM`. |
| `address` | Byte offset within the region. |
| `data_hex` | The bytes, two hex digits each, upper or lower case; at most 1048576 bytes. |

Writes as a debugger does: no bus cycle is made and no device is clocked. The bytes are laid out
as `memory.read` of the same region reads them.

- The whole range is checked first. So the write happens completely or not at all.
- The ROMs cannot be written.
- `AUDIO_RAM` is written at the 68000's time: the Z80 is brought up to it first.

```json
{"id":4,"method":"memory.write","params":{"region":"WORK_RAM","address":"0x100","data_hex":"deadbeef"}}
{"id":4,"ok":true,"result":{"region":"WORK_RAM","address":256,"size":4}}
```

The simulator has no such method.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `invalid_region`, `invalid_range`, `bad_request`.

### `emu.reset` (alias `sim.reset`)

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cycles` | Master ticks to hold the reset line for. |

Holds the reset line for `cycles` master ticks, running the raster on through them, and lets it
go. The 68000 fetches its vectors as soon as the machine runs. It answers `{}` once the ticks
have passed, as the simulator's does. Reset clears the IGS026's latches and the IGS023's
interrupts. It leaves RAM, the raster and the RTC alone, as the RTL does.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `bad_request`.

### `emu.run_frames` (alias `sim.run_frames`)

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `count` | Frame boundaries to run through. |

A frame boundary is where the simulator's `vblank` output rises: 11 master ticks after line 0
of the raster begins. A run stops between instructions, so it ends at most one instruction past
the boundary.

```json
{"id":4,"ok":true,"result":{"reason":"completed","ticks_executed":50687930,"frames_executed":60}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `reason` | `completed`; `breakpoint` when a CPU reached a breakpoint first; `watchpoint` when the 68000 read or wrote a watched address; `halted` when it halted on a double bus fault. |
| `breakpoint` | With `reason` `breakpoint` only: `{"cpu", "address"}`, and for the Z80 and the ARM7 `registers`, as `cpu.get_state` gives them, from the moment that CPU reached the breakpoint. |
| `watchpoint` | With `reason` `watchpoint` only: the access, as `{"address", "access": "read" or "write", "value", "bytes", "pc"}`, `pc` being the instruction that made it. |
| `ticks_executed` | Master ticks the run took. |
| `frames_executed` | Frame boundaries it passed. |

Errors: `not_loaded`, `bad_request`.

### `emu.run_cycles` (alias `sim.run_cycles`)

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `count` | Master ticks (50 MHz) to run for, as the simulator counts them. |

Answers as `emu.run_frames` does.

### `emu.run_until` (alias `sim.run_until`)

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `condition` | When to stop, below. It is checked after each instruction. |
| `timeout_cycles` | Master ticks after which to give up; 1,000,000,000 (20 s of emulated time) when left out. |

Answers as `emu.run_frames` does, with `reason` `condition_met`, or `timeout` when the time ran
out first.

The conditions are the simulator's:

| `type` | Fields | Holds when |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu_pc_equals` | `value` | the 68000's next instruction is at `value` |
| `cpu_pc_in_range` | `start`, `end` (or `value`, `value2`) | `start` <= pc < `end` |
| `cpu_pc_out_of_range` | as above | pc < `start` or pc >= `end` |
| `signal_equals`, `signal_not_equals`, `signal_less_than`, `signal_less_equal`, `signal_greater_than`, `signal_greater_equal` | `signal`, `value` | the signal compares so with `value` |
| `and`, `or` | `children`: conditions | all hold, or any holds |
| `not` | `children`: one condition | it does not hold |

| Signal | Value |
|---|---|
| `vblank` | 1 in the first 40 lines of the raster |
| `hblank` | 1 in the first 192 dots of a line |
| `line` | The raster's line, 0 to 263, 0 being where vblank begins (the emulator's own) |
| `frame` | Frame boundaries passed since power-up (the emulator's own) |

The simulator also resolves names of RTL signals through Verilator. The emulator has no such
signals and answers `invalid_signal` for them.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `invalid_signal`, `bad_request`.

### `cpu.get_state`

Takes no parameters, or `cpu`: `m68k`, the default, `z80`, or `arm7` for the IGS027A's ARM7TDMI.

```json
{"id":5,"ok":true,"result":{"pc":4166,"registers":[0,4294967295,"..."],"disasm":"move.l  D2, -(A7)",
  "d":[0,4294967295,0,0,0,0,0,0],"a":[8394064,8401830,0,0,0,0,8519628,8519608],
  "sr":8196,"usp":0,"ssp":8519608,"stopped":false,"halted":false}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pc` | The address of the instruction the 68000 executes next. |
| `registers` | The simulator's 17 longs, in fx68k's order: D0-D7, A0-A6, then the user and the supervisor stack pointer. |
| `disasm` | The instruction at `pc`. |
| `d`, `a` | The data and address registers; A7 is the stack pointer in use. |
| `sr`, `usp`, `ssp` | Status register and the two stack pointers. |
| `stopped`, `halted` | Whether a STOP is waiting for an interrupt, and whether the 68000 has halted. |

For the Z80 the answer is its registers, named as the SingleStepTests suite names them, and
whether it is in a HALT. They are as of the last time the sound side was brought up to the
68000's time, which is at the end of every run.

```json
{"id":5,"ok":true,"result":{"pc":1234,"sp":16384,"af":65535,"bc":0,"de":0,"hl":0,"ix":0,"iy":0,
  "af_":65535,"bc_":0,"de_":0,"hl_":0,"wz":0,"i":0,"r":17,"im":1,"iff1":true,"iff2":true,"halted":false}}
```

For the ARM7, as of the last time it was brought up to the 68000's time:

```json
{"id":5,"ok":true,"result":{"pc":460,"r":[268435495,0,"...",468],"cpsr":1610612755,"spsr":0,
  "mode":"supervisor","thumb":false,"fiq":false,"cycles":303790052,"disasm":"bl 0x00001438"}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pc` | The address of the instruction it executes next. |
| `r` | R0 to R15 as its mode sees them; R15 is the pipeline's, 8 (ARM) or 4 (Thumb) past `pc`. |
| `cpsr`, `spsr` | The status registers; `spsr` is 0 in user and system modes, which have none. |
| `mode`, `thumb` | The mode's name (`user`, `fiq`, `irq`, `supervisor`, `abort`, `undefined`, `system`) and the instruction set. |
| `fiq` | Whether the FIQ line is up. |
| `cycles` | Its clock's cycles since its reset. |

Errors: `not_loaded`, `no_cpu`, `bad_request`.

### `cpu.disassemble`

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `address` | Where to start. |
| `count` | Instructions to disassemble, at most 1000. |
| `cpu` | `m68k`, the default, or `arm7`. |
| `thumb` | For the ARM7: Thumb instructions rather than ARM; if left out, the set it is in. |

Answers an array of `{"address", "length", "text"}`, one per instruction, read as the CPU would
read them, without clocking any device or setting off what reading some of them does.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `no_cpu`, `bad_request`.

### `debug.breakpoint.add`, `debug.breakpoint.remove`

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `address` | The instruction address. |
| `cpu` | `m68k`, the default, `z80`, or `arm7` for the IGS027A's ARM7TDMI. |

`add` and `remove` answer `{}`. A run that reaches a breakpoint answers `reason` `breakpoint`, and
`breakpoint` says which (`emu.run_frames`).

- **68000.** The run stops before the instruction. The next run executes that instruction rather
  than stopping at it again. A breakpoint in code that runs every frame stops every run within a
  frame; remove it to run on.
- **Z80 and ARM7.** These CPUs are brought up to the 68000's time, not run beside it. So the run
  stops after the 68000 instruction during which the CPU reached the breakpoint. The CPU itself is
  not stopped there: it has run on to the 68000's time. That is the end of one 68000 instruction,
  or later when the 68000 was waiting: for an interrupt, for sprite DMA, or in reset. The answer's
  `registers` are as they were at the breakpoint; `cpu.get_state` gives them as they are now. The
  emulation is the same as without the breakpoint
  ([0023](../decisions/0023-breakpoints-on-the-caught-up-cpus.md)).
- While the Z80 or the ARM7 has a breakpoint, runs are slower: both are brought up to the 68000
  after each of its instructions.
- A Z80 breakpoint is at a Z80 address, 0 to 0xFFFF. It is reached where the Z80 fetches an
  instruction's first byte.
- An ARM7 breakpoint is reached where the ARM begins an instruction, ARM or Thumb.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `no_cpu` (`arm7` on a board without an IGS027A), `bad_request`.

### `debug.breakpoint.list`

Takes `cpu`, as above. Answers the addresses of that CPU's breakpoints, ascending.

### `debug.watchpoint.add`, `debug.watchpoint.remove`, `debug.watchpoint.list`

A watchpoint stops a run after the 68000 instruction that reads or writes data in its range.
Instruction fetches and reads relative to the PC do not count; DMA does not either.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `address` | The range's first address; one watchpoint per address, a second replacing the first. |
| `size` | Bytes in the range, 1 if left out. |
| `access` | `read`, `write` (the default) or `access` for both. |

`debug.watchpoint.remove` takes `address`. `debug.watchpoint.list` answers
`{"watchpoints":[{"address","size","access"}]}`.

### `debug.trace`

The last instructions the 68000 executed, oldest first: up to 4096 are kept, always.

```json
{"id":8,"ok":true,"result":{"instructions":[{"pc":1294,"ticks":5023441,"disasm":"bra.s   $50e"}]}}
```

`count` asks for how many, 32 if left out. `ticks` is when the instruction began.

### `state.save`, `state.load`, `state.list` (as the simulator has them)

`state.save` writes the whole machine's state to `filename`; `state.load` restores it into the
same game. A `filename` without a directory is in the state directory (`pgmemu-cli
--state-dir`, or the working directory). `state.list` answers the `.pgmstate` files there,
`{"states":["a.pgmstate"]}`.

A state holds everything a run changes, and none of the ROMs, breakpoints, watchpoints or the
trace. It is read back by the build that wrote it: the layout carries a version, and a state of
another version, or of another game, is refused with `state_mismatch`. Loading a state, then
running, gives exactly the frames, memory and sound that followed when it was saved.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `state_failed`, `state_mismatch`, `bad_request`.

### `nvram.save`, `nvram.load` (as the simulator has them)

The board keeps its 128 KB of work RAM on a battery. These write it to `filename` and read it
back, laid out as the RTL's NVRAM interface lays it out: each 16-bit word's low byte first.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `nvram_failed`, `bad_request`.

### `video.screenshot`

The last complete picture: 448 by 224 pixels, completed where vertical blank begins, so just
before every frame boundary.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path` | Where to write it as a PNG of RGB pixels, as the simulator writes one. Left out, the PNG comes back in the answer. |

```json
{"id":6,"ok":true,"result":{"width":448,"height":224,"frame":61,"path":"frame.png"}}
{"id":7,"ok":true,"result":{"width":448,"height":224,"frame":61,"png_base64":"iVBORw0..."}}
```

`frame` counts the pictures completed since power-up.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `screenshot_failed`.

### `audio.capture_start`

Starts recording the ICS2115's output, from the next run on, into a WAV file: 16-bit stereo, at
the chip's own rate, one frame per sample period (32 of its clocks per active voice, about
33 kHz with all 32). Nothing is resampled. A run adds what it produced when it ends.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path` | Where to write the WAV. |

```json
{"id":8,"ok":true,"result":{"path":"bios.wav"}}
```

The simulator's `audio_capture.start` records the same frames, but as its packet stream rather
than a WAV, so the two are not aliases; `scripts/compare-with-rtl.py --audio` reads both.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `capture_running`, `capture_failed`, `bad_request`.

### `audio.capture_stop`

Ends the capture, completes the file and answers what it holds. `sample_rate` is the rate the
frames came at, as their times give it.

```json
{"id":9,"ok":true,"result":{"path":"bios.wav","frames":497633,"sample_rate":33072}}
```

Errors: `capture_not_running`.

### `audio.voices`

The ICS2115's active voices and their registers, in the chip's own units: `osc_acc`,
`osc_start` and `osc_end` are 20.9 fixed-point sample addresses in the bank `osc_saddr` selects,
`vol_acc`, `vol_start` and `vol_end` are 26-bit envelope levels, of which the top 12 bits index
the volume table.

```json
{"id":10,"ok":true,"result":{"active":32,"voices":[{"osc_acc":0,"osc_fc":0,"osc_start":0,"osc_end":0,"osc_saddr":0,"osc_conf":2,"osc_ctl":0,"vol_acc":0,"vol_start":0,"vol_end":0,"vol_incr":0,"vol_pan":127,"vol_ctrl":1,"vol_mode":0}]}}
```

Errors: `not_loaded`.

### `input.set`, `input.clear` (as the simulator has them)

Holds a control of player 1 down, or lets it go, until the next change.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `button1` (or `btn1`, `a`) and `start`, the simulator's names; and the emulator's own `button2`, `button3`, `button4` and `coin`. |

```json
{"id":11,"ok":true,"result":{}}
```

Errors: `not_loaded`, `invalid_input`, `bad_request`.

### `input.press` (as the simulator has it)

Holds a control for two frames, then lets it go for two: four frames run, and the answer is
`emu.run_frames`'s for all four. Takes `name`, as `input.set` does.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `invalid_input`, `bad_request`.

### `input.get_state` (as the simulator has it)

The controls held, as the simulator encodes them: its `joystick_p1` bits (right 0x01, left 0x02,
down 0x04, up 0x08, buttons 1 to 4 from 0x10), start at 0x10000, and the coin at 0x100000.

```json
{"id":12,"ok":true,"result":{"buttons":65552}}
```

### `video.registers`

IGS023's 16 registers in `registers`, its zoom table in `zoom_table`, and the scroll registers
named: `background_scroll` and `text_scroll` as `{"x","y"}`, `line_counter` and `flags`.

### `video.sprites`

The sprites of the list sprite DMA last copied from work RAM, at line 221: the picture shows
them from the next vertical blank. In list order; a later sprite draws over an earlier one.

```json
{"id":9,"ok":true,"result":{"count":13,"sprites":[{"x":0,"y":40,"scale_x":16,"scale_y":16,"flip_x":false,
  "flip_y":false,"low_priority":true,"palette":9,"mask_address":5601420,"width":28,"height":136}]}}
```

`width` is in 16-pixel units, `height` in lines, `mask_address` a word address in the B ROM.

### `video.layers`

Which of the text, background and sprite layers the picture is drawn with, to see what lies
under one. `text`, `background` and `sprites` are booleans; those given are set, and the answer
is all three. Lines drawn from then on, and so screenshots, follow it. It is a debugger's
setting, not the machine's: save states do not hold it, and the next game loaded draws all three.

### `video.tiles`

Tiles from the tile ROMs as an image: the text layer's, 8 by 8, or the background's, 32 by 32.

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `layer` | `text` or `background`. |
| `first` | The first tile code; 0 if left out. |
| `count` | How many, 1 to 4096; 256 if left out. |
| `columns` | Tiles to a row; 16 if left out. |
| `palette` | The layer's palette group, 0 to 31; 0 if left out. |
| `path`, `format` | As below. |

### `video.tilemap`

A layer's whole tile map as an image, unscrolled: the text layer's 64 by 32 tiles (512 by 256
pixels), and the background's 64 by 16 (2048 by 512), which is all its 4 KB of VRAM holds; the
chip reads the 16 rows over and over down its 2048 lines. Takes `layer`, `path` and `format`.

The images of `video.tiles` and `video.tilemap` show a transparent pixel dark grey. With `path`
an image is written there as a PNG; without it, it comes back as a PNG in `png_base64`, or, with
`format` `rgba`, as raw RGBA rows in `rgba_base64`. `width` and `height` come back either way.

Errors: `not_loaded`, `bad_request`, `screenshot_failed`.

### `test.status`

The block PGMTest's pages publish their state in, at the top of work RAM, 0x81F000: a 16-bit
magic naming the page, then words whose meaning is the page's own (its `TestStatus` in
`testroms/pages/` of the MiSTer core).

```json
{"id":11,"ok":true,"result":{"address":8515584,"magic":22100,"name":"VT","words":[22100,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,8192,0,0,0]}}
```

`words` asks for how many words, the magic included: 32 if left out, at most 2048. `name` is the
magic as two characters.

### `debug_link.start`, `debug_link.write`, `debug_link.read`, `debug_link.stop` (as the simulator has them)

PGMTest's debug link, as the simulator serves it: the test ROM publishes a block in work RAM,
marked `RFIF`, with a ring of bytes each way, and the link attaches to it and marks it active.
The ROM mailbox the board's PicoROM uses is not emulated, so `debug_link.start`'s `comms_addr`
is taken and not used.

- `debug_link.write {data_hex, timeout_cycles_per_byte}` runs the machine until the test ROM has
  published its block and the bytes fit in its ring.
- `debug_link.read {max_bytes, min_bytes, timeout_cycles}` runs it until at least `min_bytes`
  have come, or the time is up, and answers `{"data_hex", "available"}`: at most `max_bytes`, and
  how many more are waiting.
- `debug_link.stop` marks the block inactive.

Timeouts are master ticks, 2000000 if left out. Errors: `not_loaded`, `debug_link_timeout`,
`bad_request`.
