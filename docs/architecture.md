# Architecture

This document covers what the components are, how emulated time and data flow through them,
and why the boundaries sit where they do. The reasoning behind individual choices is in
[the decision records](decisions/). Facts about the board itself are in PGMTech
(`../PGMTech/README.md`) and the RTL (`../Arcade-IGSPGM_MiSTer/rtl`), and are not repeated here
([0002](decisions/0002-the-fpga-core-is-the-reference.md)).

The core is a library with no SDL, no ImGui, no threads and no file dialogs, and it is
deterministic: the same `.pgm`, BIOS, inputs and RTC seed always give the same frames, audio and
RAM. Everything else is a client of it. The boundary is drawn for three reasons:

- **Testability.** The suite links the core and nothing else, so every hardware module is tested
  headless.
- **Determinism.** Determinism is what makes golden frames and comparison against the RTL
  possible.
- **Agent use.** An agent session reaches the same machine the GUI shows, through the same
  dispatcher.

## Emulated time

The RTL clocks the whole board from one 50 MHz clock through fractional clock enables. The
emulator keeps the same arrangement. Time is a 64-bit count of 10 ns units, half a master tick:
the largest unit in which both the 68000's and the pixel clock's periods are whole (5 and 10
units). Each clock domain is the RTL's own ratio of the master clock:

| Domain | Ratio of 50 MHz | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| 68000 | 2/5 | 20 MHz |
| Pixel (IGS023) | 1/5 | 10 MHz |
| ICS2115 | 615/908 | 33.865 MHz |
| Z80 | 615/908 / 4 | 8.466 MHz |
| ARM7 | per game, from `PGM.sv` | 20 to 33.87 MHz |

Because the ratios are the RTL's, a timing difference against the simulation is a bug in the
emulator, not rounding. The clocks with ratios that do not divide evenly are counted in closed
form from master ticks, as `jtframe_frac_cen` counts them, so a device asks how many pulses of
its clock have passed instead of being stepped through each one.

**The 68k leads and everything else catches up.**

1. The 68k runs an instruction at a time. Before each one the raster is brought up to the
   present, so the interrupt lines it sees are those of that moment. Moira calls back before
   every bus cycle, so a cycle reaches its device at the time the 68000 makes it. A 68000
   stopped by STOP skips straight to the next raster event, which is the only thing that can
   wake it.
2. The Z80, the ICS2115, the ARM7 and the video are brought up to the 68k's present before any
   access that could observe or change them. That covers a latch read or write, the Z80 RAM
   window, a bus request, protection shared RAM, and a video register read such as the line
   counter.
3. At the end of every slice, all of them are brought up to the present.

The alternative, interleaving every chip in fixed small quanta, costs more and is still less
exact. What PGM games depend on is the *order* of cross-CPU communication, and catch-up on
access gives that order exactly.

## The core's modules

Each hardware module ports one RTL module, and the module header names its source:

| Module | RTL |
|---|---|
| `Bus68k` | `address_translator.sv`, chip-select mux in `PGM.sv` |
| `Igs023` | `igs023.sv`, `igs023_bg.sv`, `igs023_fg.sv`, `igs023_sprite.sv`, `igs023_buffer.sv` |
| `Ics2115` | `ics2115/*.sv` |
| `Igs026` | `igs026_x.sv` |
| `Z80` | `tv80s`, as `PGM.sv` wires it, on `z80.h` ([0003](decisions/0003-cpu-cores.md)) |
| `V3021` | `v3021.sv` |
| `Asic3` | `pgm_asic3.sv` |
| `Igs025` | `igs025.sv` |
| `Igs022` | `igs022.sv` |
| `Igs027a` | `igs027a.sv` |

How some of these modules work, and why:

- **`Bus68k`.** The board's decode, by the address's top bits, behind the cartridge's
  protection: a `Protection` names the 64 KB pages it has an address in, and only there is it
  asked first. Which protection a cartridge brings is decided from its own data where that
  tells (the hardware class, the I25 block's variant), and from its set name where only the RTL's
  per-game table does (`Boards`). Wait states are charged through Moira's `sync()` hook
  ([0003](decisions/0003-cpu-cores.md)).
- **`Igs023`: video is drawn a line at a time, sprites a frame at a time**
  ([0011](decisions/0011-video-is-drawn-by-line-and-by-frame.md)). A line is drawn when the RTL
  starts fetching it; the sprite layer is drawn from the list the DMA copies at line 221, and
  shown from the next vertical blank. The sprite engine (`SpriteEngine`) ports the RTL's prescan
  and row drawing state by state, its zoom patterns and its quirks included.
- **`Igs026` keeps the sound side's time.** The Z80 runs a T-state per ce_8m pulse, and the
  ICS2115 is brought to the Z80's time whenever the Z80 reaches it and whenever it next acts
  on its own (a sample tick, a timer), which is when its IRQ, the Z80's /INT, can change.
  Between those the Z80 runs without looking at it.
- **`Ics2115`: audio is produced at the chip's own rate.** That is one stereo sample every
  `(oscillators + 1) × 32` chip clocks. Resampling to the host rate is the frontend's job, so
  the suite can compare the native stream with WAVs captured from the RTL simulation. A sample
  period's voices are processed one after another at the times the RTL's sequencer reaches
  them, so that a write from the Z80 reaches the same voices in the same period as there
  ([differences](hardware/differences.md)).
- **`Igs027a` comes in board variants.** Types 1, 2 and 3 differ in their memory map and latch.
  The variant and the ARM clock follow from the `.pgm` header's hardware class and the RTL's
  per-game table.

## The cartridge

The core reads the `.pgm` file PGMBuilder writes ([spec/pgm-format.md](spec/pgm-format.md)), and a
BIOS from `pgm.zip` or a directory.
The two halves are separate because PGMBuilder leaves the BIOS out of every image.

PGMBuilder has already decrypted the 68k program and the ARM external ROM, and descrambled
happy6, so none of that exists in the emulator.

A game learns its region from its protection, and the image says which protection holds it
and which regions it can be ([spec/pgm-format.md §4](spec/pgm-format.md)). The emulator runs a
game as the region its image holds unless another is chosen when it is loaded; choosing one
powers the board up anew, since the region is the chip's from its reset (`emu.set_region`).

The RTL simulator's own `.pgm` loader targets version 0x0010 and is not a reference.

## The control API

Every capability is a method of `control::Dispatcher`
([0005](decisions/0005-one-control-api.md)). The method groups follow the RTL simulator:

- `emu.*` (alias `sim.*`): load, reset, run frames or cycles, run until a condition
- `memory.*`
- `cpu.*`: for `m68k`, `z80` and `arm7`
- `debug.*`: breakpoints, watchpoints, trace
- `video.*`: screenshot, registers, decoded sprites, layers, tiles
- `audio.*`
- `input.*`
- `state.*`, `nvram.*`
- `test.*`: the PGMTest result block and its RFIF debug link

The transports are thin, and none adds a capability of its own:

- JSON-lines on stdio (`pgmemu-cli --server`) and TCP (`pgmemu --server tcp:PORT`)
- MCP on stdio (`pgmemu-cli --mcp`) and HTTP (`pgmemu --mcp-http PORT`)

A request from a GUI-attached transport is executed on the emulation thread between two slices,
so the person at the GUI watches what the agent does.

`pgmemu-cli --batch` runs batch scripts ([spec/batch.md](spec/batch.md)): requests of the
protocol, with checkpoints at which the picture, the RAMs and the sound are summed, run
unthrottled. They are the building block of the golden-frame tests.

## The desktop frontend

`pgmemu` is SDL3 with Dear ImGui (docking). Gearlynx is the conceptual model for the event loop,
gamepad handling and debugger layout; none of its code is used
([0004](decisions/0004-licence-gpl-2.md)).

**Threads:**

- The core runs on its own emulation thread (`EmulationThread`). It runs frames at the board's
  pace, and between two frames answers the requests queued for it. It hands each finished
  picture over under a lock, and its sound straight to the audio stream. It keeps the state after
  each of the last 30 seconds' frames, which a rewind steps back through
  ([0018](decisions/0018-rewind-keeps-every-frame.md)).
- The GUI thread never touches the core. It takes pictures and sends dispatcher requests through
  the queue, the same path the network transports use; the keyboard reaches the machine as the
  host's inputs, apart from those the protocol holds.
- Headless mode has one thread.

**Pacing:** the host's monotonic clock paces the emulation at the board's 59.19 frames a
second, whatever the display's refresh rate. The sound goes to an SDL audio stream at the chip's
own rate; SDL resamples it to the device's, and dynamic rate control pulls that resampling by up
to half a percent to keep the queue near its target as the two clocks drift. Without an audio
device the clock paces alone. Fast-forward, pause, frame step and rewind sit on top of it.

**Input:**

- Four players, from the keyboard and from SDL gamepads with hot-plug.
- Per-player bindings, plus hotkeys: rewind, on any gamepad.
- ImGui captures input while a debugger window has focus.

**Debugger windows:**

- disassembly and registers for each CPU
- memory editor
- IGS023 registers, tilemaps, sprite list and layer toggles
- palette
- ICS2115 voices
- IGS026 latches
- protection state
- trace
- PGMTest status

## Save states

Each module writes a tagged chunk (`FOURCC`, version, size). A state is a header, the chunks, and
an optional thumbnail. Tagged chunks let a module's layout change without invalidating other
modules' data, and let a tool read one module out of a state. Rewind and run-ahead keep a ring of
states in memory, built on the same serializer. Work RAM is battery-backed on the board and is
saved per game as NVRAM.

## Testing

Five kinds of evidence, each catching what the others cannot:

1. **CPU single-step suites:** SingleStepTests 680x0, FUSE/zexall, SingleStepTests ARM7TDMI.
   They hold the cores to the ISA.
2. **Unit tests:** the `.pgm` reader, bus decode, latch semantics, envelope arithmetic and the
   sprite mask decoder. They hold each module to its RTL source.
3. **PGMTest pages** run headless. Each page reports through its result block at WRAM 0x81F000
   or through the RFIF debug link. They hold the machine to hardware-derived expectations.
4. **Golden frames:** batch scripts in `tests/regression/`, per game and per PGMTest page, with
   the sums of the picture, the RAMs and the sound at their checkpoints under scripted input
   (`ctest -L regression`). They catch regressions; they were recorded from the emulator, so a
   change to them is checked against the RTL before it is recorded.
5. **Comparison against the RTL simulation:** the same script drives both over the one protocol,
   compares memory, frames and sound, and bisects to the frame, the line and the instruction
   where memory first differs. It is the main instrument for matching the core. The simulation
   runs at about 1.4 frames per second, so this runs on demand, not in the suite, and always
   from the reset: the simulation's own save states do not reload exactly.
